# Taxi-out-time-prediction-system
Predicts aircraft taxi-out time using machine learning to improve airport efficiency and reduce delays.       
✈️ Taxi-Out Time Prediction System
This project aims to predict the taxi-out time of aircrafts using machine learning techniques. Taxi-out time refers to the time taken by an aircraft to move from the gate to the runway before takeoff. Accurate predictions can help reduce flight delays and improve airport traffic management.
